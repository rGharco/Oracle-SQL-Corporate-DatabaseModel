# 🚀 Overview  
This database model is designed to simulate a **corporate environment** featuring a  **ticketing system** alongside  **client promotions**.  
It represents the **foundational schema** covering the essential elements common to such systems and serves as a **starting point** for further development and customization.

# 🗂️ Database Design  
This is my **first database design project**, so the model is not fully optimized yet.  
However, it provides a **solid base** that can be easily extended or refined.  

For a clearer understanding, please check the **diagram PDF**  which presents the schema in a more visually organized and accessible format.

# ⚙️ How to Use  
1. Run the script to **create the tables**.  
2. Run the script to **insert sample data**.  

❗ **Warning:**  
The `create_tables` script will **drop any existing tables** with the same names (e.g., `Clients`) before creating new ones.  
**Make sure to back up any important data before proceeding!**

# 💻 Software & SQL Language  
- **Software:** Oracle SQL Developer  
- **SQL Dialect:** Oracle SQL
