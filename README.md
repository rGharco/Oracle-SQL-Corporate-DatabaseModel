# OVERVIEW
A database model meant to replicate the a corporate environemnt where a ticketing system takes place and promotions for clients are also available. It represent the bare minimum of any database and should be used to save time and develop on top of it

# DATABASE DESIGN
As for now, it is my first project where I had to design a database and thus it is far from perfect.
However it can easily be worked on top and saves some time. The design includes useful tables and for a better and clearer view, make sure to take a look at the diagram pdf as it has a much prettier format and makes it easy to follow along.

# HOW TO USE
Simply run the scripts, firstly the one to create the tables and then the inserts, or if used for production , leave that to be done by the web application or software in place.

! Rememeber that the create_tables script will delete tables that use the same name as the one assigned for this schema, so if you have other tables called (e.g Clients) it will delete them. Proceed with caution!
